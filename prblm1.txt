`Scenario: Employee Attendance and Salary Calculation`  
`Problem Statement:`  
A company wants to automate its `employee attendance and 
salary calculation system` using C programming. 
The company follows these rules:  

1. An employee can work for a `maximum of 30 days per month`.
2. The `basic salary` of an employee is `fixed` 
   but varies from employee to employee.
3. If an employee works for `more than 25 days`, 
   they receive a `5% attendance bonus` on their salary.
4. If an employee works for `less than 10 days`, 
   they receive `only 50%` of their salary.
5. The company wants to `classify employees` 
   based on their working days:  
   - `Excellent` (More than 25 days)  
   - `Good` (Between 15 and 25 days)  
   - `Needs Improvement` (Less than 15 days)  

`Requirements:`  
1. `Input:`  
   - Employee Name  
   - Employee ID  
   - Basic Salary  
   - Total Days Worked (between 0 to 30)  

2. `Output:`  
   - Final Salary (after applying rules)  
   - Attendance Bonus (if applicable)  
   - Employee Performance Category

3. `Control Statements (if-else, loops)` → Applying salary rules and performance classification.  
4. `Complexity Analysis` → Understanding how the logic scales when the company has many employees.
