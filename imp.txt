The use of a pointer allows for dynamic memory allocation, meaning the size of the name can vary based on input, rather than being fixed.
The typedef keyword allows you to create an alias for a data type. In this case, it is creating an alias called Student for the structure defined.
This means you can now use Student as a type instead of having to write struct each time you want to declare a variable of this structure type.
